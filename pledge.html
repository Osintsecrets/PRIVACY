            <p>Ethical access means honoring the people, communities, and systems that make knowledge possible. You are about to enter a space that shares insights, research, and tools meant to uplift defenders and caretakers of privacy. With every technique you learn here comes the responsibility to wield it with empathy and restraint. The safeguards that protect one person should never become the weapons that dismantle another.</p>
            <p>As you read, commit to pausing before you act. Ask whether each use respects consent, legality, and human dignity. Information can illuminate, but it can also expose. Our promise is to teach with integrity; your promise is to apply this learning with the same care. When in doubt, choose transparency, compassion, and protection.</p>
            <p>This pledge is not a formality. It is a living ethic that keeps this project aligned with its purpose. If you cannot agree to uphold these values, you must exit now. If you can, take the time to read, reflect, and confirm. Together we can build a safer, kinder digital world.</p>
