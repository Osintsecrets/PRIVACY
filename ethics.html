      <h1>Ethics: The Line That Defines Us</h1>
      <p class="lead">Humanity Above All</p>
      <section class="card">
        <p>Strip away the usernames, the arguments, the headlines, the noise — and what remains is all that ever mattered: we are human beings. Not profiles. Not opinions. Not enemies. People. Flesh and blood. Fragile. Imperfect. Sacred. And that simple truth is where every ethical decision must begin.</p>
        <p>In a world where hate thrives in comment sections and lives are reduced to data points, ethics are more than a guideline — they are the last line between civilization and chaos. They remind us that behind every screen is a heart that beats, a mind that feels, and a soul that deserves dignity.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Public ≠ Permission</h2>
        <p>One of the most dangerous lies we tell ourselves online is this: “If it’s public, it’s fair game.” It’s not. It never was.</p>
        <p>People share pieces of their lives online — often without understanding how those fragments can be stitched together. They trust that strangers will act with decency. They don’t imagine that one careless photo, one old post, or one forgotten account could one day be weaponized against them.</p>
        <p>Ethics demand that we honor that trust — even when it’s unspoken. Just because something is visible does not mean it’s yours to use. Privacy does not end where the “public” label begins.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Doxxing Is Never, Ever Justified</h2>
        <p>Let this be carved in stone: Doxxing is not justice. Doxxing is not accountability. Doxxing is cruelty.</p>
        <p>It is the act of turning information into a weapon — and once unleashed, that weapon cannot be controlled. It can shatter careers. It can destroy families. It can end lives. And the justification — “They deserved it,” “They were wrong,” “They offended me” — does not make you righteous. It makes you dangerous.</p>
        <p>If someone commits a crime, document it and report it. That’s your duty. But to expose, shame, and endanger them because you feel they should be punished? That is not justice — that is vengeance. And vengeance has no place in the world of ethical intelligence.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Vigilantism Has No Honor</h2>
        <p>We have laws. We have courts. We have systems designed — however flawed — to weigh evidence and deliver consequences. You are not the police. You are not the judge. You are not the executioner.</p>
        <p>Vigilantism online is no different from vigilantism in the real world: it is chaos disguised as justice. It undermines the very principles it claims to defend. If someone says something vile, speak to them. Debate them. Ignore them. But do not decide that their private life is yours to expose. That is not bravery. That is cowardice hiding behind a keyboard.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Consent Doesn’t Vanish in the Digital World</h2>
        <p>We teach consent in our physical lives. We teach boundaries. We teach respect. Yet somehow, we abandon those lessons the moment we step online.</p>
        <p>Consent matters here too. It matters when you collect information. It matters when you analyze it. It matters when you decide what to do with it. If you would never walk into someone’s home uninvited, why would you walk into their digital life without permission? If you would never want your personal world torn apart and exposed, why would you do it to someone else?</p>
        <p>The Golden Rule did not expire with the invention of Wi-Fi. Treat others as you would want to be treated — online, offline, always.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Power Demands Discipline</h2>
        <p>With the power to find people comes the duty to protect them. With the ability to uncover their lives comes the responsibility to do no harm. This is not a suggestion — it is an oath.</p>
        <p>There will be no one standing over your shoulder telling you what you can or cannot do. No one will police your thoughts or stop your searches. That responsibility is yours — and yours alone. You must be the one who asks the hard questions before you act:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Should I?</li>
          <li>Why am I doing this?</li>
          <li>Who could be hurt by my actions?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Just because something is possible doesn’t mean it’s right. The internet is already dark enough — don’t be the reason it gets darker. Be the reason it gets brighter. Don’t harm people. Protect them. Don’t expose them. Shield them. Don’t weaponize what you know. Use it to make the world safer.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>The Code We Must Live By</h2>
        <p>If you choose to wield the power of information, then you must also bear the weight of responsibility. These are not rules — they are promises. Break them, and you break the very soul of what this work is meant to be.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Humanity first. Every dataset belongs to a living, breathing person.</li>
          <li>Public is not permission. Visibility does not erase responsibility.</li>
          <li>Doxxing is never acceptable. No justification makes it right.</li>
          <li>Report — don’t retaliate. If it’s criminal, report it. If it’s not, leave it.</li>
          <li>Consent matters online. Digital boundaries are real boundaries.</li>
          <li>Use your power for good. Do not deepen the darkness. Be the light.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>This Is the Line</h2>
        <p>In the end, it all comes down to one choice: what kind of person do you want to be?</p>
        <p>You can be the reason someone hides, the reason someone suffers, the reason someone’s life is torn apart — or you can be the reason someone sleeps easier at night, the reason they feel safe, the reason the internet is a little less cruel.</p>
        <p>Ethics are the line that separates those two paths. They are the difference between power that protects and power that destroys. And at the end of the day — no matter how skilled you become, no matter how much data you uncover — one truth remains: we are all human. And if we forget that, we have no business holding anyone’s information in our hands.</p>
