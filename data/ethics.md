MISSION AND DUTY:
We operate solely to protect the privacy, agency, and psychological safety of the people who trust us. Every assessment is framed around minimizing risk, preventing exploitation, and strengthening informed consent.

CORE PRINCIPLES
- Privacy-first intelligence gathering for defensive readiness.
- Consent before any data is accessed, processed, or shared.
✋ We never weaponize insights for harassment, doxing, intimidation, or political targeting.

PRACTICAL BOUNDARIES:
Our investigations focus on exposures already visible to the account holder or their authorized team. We do not penetrate accounts, defeat platform safeguards, or encourage adversarial breaches. If a requested action crosses that line, we decline the task.

HUMAN IMPACT:
We recognize that digital harm extends beyond metrics. We weigh trauma, reputational damage, and downstream abuse when advising on next steps. Psychological welfare, especially for marginalized communities, guides the pace and scope of our work.

SAFEGUARDS IN PRACTICE:
- Limit retention to the shortest window needed to deliver remediation guidance.
- ✋ Pause work immediately if a client signals discomfort or revokes consent.
- Document sources, transformations, and recommendations for accountability.

ESCALATION:
When we encounter imminent harm, we prioritize de-escalation and protection. We coordinate with trusted partners only when the impacted person provides explicit approval, or when legal obligations require notification.

ACCOUNTABILITY:
We invite peer review, red teaming, and transparent critique of our methodologies. Findings that expose bias or unintended harm trigger corrective action plans and public documentation of the fix.
