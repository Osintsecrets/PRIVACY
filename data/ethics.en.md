MISSION & DUTY
We exist solely to help people reclaim privacy, safety, and informed consent online. Every investigation starts with the question: does this lower risk for the person who asked for help?

WHO WE SERVE
Our guides are written for everyday people, activists, and journalists who are being targeted or feel exposed. We adapt recommendations to the comfort level, trauma history, and time of the person in danger.

CONSENT & CONTROL
We never move forward without explicit permission from the account holder or their documented delegate. Consent can be withdrawn at any time—when that happens, we pause immediately and confirm next steps in writing.

HOW WE HANDLE DATA
- Collect only the minimum details needed to understand the exposure.
- Store evidence securely for the shortest window required to produce recommendations.
- Track who accessed what, when, and why for full accountability.

SAFETY BOUNDARIES
We limit our work to surfaces the account owner can already view. We do not defeat platform protections, run intrusion tooling, or encourage any adversarial actions that could escalate harm.

WHAT WE REFUSE
- Weaponizing findings for harassment, doxing, or intimidation.
- Gathering intelligence for political targeting or commercial resale.
- Any request that discriminates or violates human-rights law.

SUPPORT & ESCALATION
We weigh psychological impact alongside technical risk. When a situation signals imminent harm, we prioritize de-escalation, safety planning, and connections to trusted responders—always with the affected person’s consent unless law requires otherwise.

ACCOUNTABILITY & IMPROVEMENT
Peer review, red teaming, and community feedback are built into our cycle. When we find bias or unintended harm in our methods, we publish the issue, fix it, and document the change so others can hold us to the same bar.
