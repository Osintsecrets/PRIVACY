This Comprehensive Legal, Ethical, and Moral Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") governs your use of the Social Risk Audit application (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Disclaimer. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using the Service.

The Service is provided for educational, research, and risk-awareness purposes only. Nothing contained within the Service should be construed as legal advice, security guarantees, crisis management direction, or a substitute for professional counsel. You alone bear responsibility for obtaining qualified legal, regulatory, psychological, security, or other professional assistance as needed.

Any recommendations, checklists, or automated assessments generated by the Service are illustrative and exploratory. They may be incomplete, outdated, or inapplicable to your circumstances. You must independently verify all information before acting, and you accept full responsibility for all decisions and outcomes that result from your reliance on the Service.

Use of the Service does not create any attorney-client, fiduciary, advisory, or confidential relationship between you and the operators, contributors, or affiliates of the Service. No duty of care is assumed or implied. The Service is provided strictly on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, availability, or non-infringement.

You acknowledge that the Service may reference third-party platforms, policies, or resources. Such references are provided solely for convenience and do not constitute endorsement, partnership, guarantee, or control over third-party actions. All trademarks and intellectual property remain the property of their respective owners.

You agree not to use the Service to violate any applicable law, regulation, platform rule, contractual obligation, or ethical standard. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all laws and policies that govern your organization, jurisdiction, or professional practice, including obligations related to privacy, consent, digital security, and human rights.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the operators, maintainers, contributors, licensors, and affiliates of the Service disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including without limitation loss of profits, data, reputation, or goodwill, arising from or in connection with the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

By continuing to access or use the Service you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction, possess the legal capacity to enter into this Disclaimer, and accept all risks associated with the Service. If you are accepting this Disclaimer on behalf of an organization, you further represent that you have authority to bind that organization.

If any provision of this Disclaimer is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. This Disclaimer shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in your jurisdiction, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

By selecting "I Agree" you affirm that you have read this Disclaimer in full, understand it, and consent to be bound by all of its terms. If you do not agree, select "I Do Not Agree" and discontinue use of the Service immediately.
