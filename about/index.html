    <h1>About OSINT Secrets</h1>

    <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
    <p>It started with nothing more than curiosity. One day, I stumbled across a conversation between Griffin Glynn and Micah Hoffman on David Bombal’s channel — and something inside me lit up...</p>

    <h2>The Darkness Beneath the Surface</h2>
    <p>OSINT isn’t always about finding fun facts or solving harmless puzzles. If you follow the threads long enough, they eventually lead somewhere darker...</p>

    <h2>The Protector Instinct</h2>
    <p>That brush with the uglier side of humanity changed something in me. It awakened a different instinct — one I didn’t expect...</p>

    <h2>Fighting Apathy With Purpose</h2>
    <p>One of the hardest things I still struggle with is how little people care about privacy...</p>

    </ol>

    <h2>Why I Stay Anonymous</h2>
    <p>From the very beginning, I chose not to attach my real name to OSINT Secrets...</p>

    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
    <p>OSINT is a journey with no finish line. It’s constantly evolving — new platforms, new tools, new threats...</p>
    <p><strong>“Not on my watch.”</strong></p>
