      <h1>Why This Project Exists</h1>
      <p class="lead">Privacy matters to me. Not because of who you are, what you believe, or where you come from — but simply because you’re a person, and people deserve privacy.</p>
      <section class="card">
        <p>That belief is at the heart of everything I do. It’s the reason this website exists. It’s the reason I pour so much time, effort, and passion into building resources like this. Because I believe privacy isn’t something society gives you — it’s something you have to take back for yourself.</p>
        <h2>Privacy Isn’t a Gift — It’s a Right</h2>
        <p>We live in a world where we hand over pieces of ourselves without even realizing it. Every photo we post, every comment we write, every app we download — it’s all part of a trail of data that says more about us than we often intend. And once that information is out there, we lose control over it.</p>
        <p>Companies profit from it. Strangers exploit it. Governments collect it. Platforms make promises they rarely keep. And while all of this happens, most people don’t even realize just how much of their privacy they’ve already surrendered.</p>
        <p>That’s not acceptable to me. Because privacy isn’t a luxury. It’s not a perk. It’s not something that should only belong to the tech-savvy, the wealthy, or the powerful. It’s a fundamental right — one that every single person should have access to, understand, and be able to protect.</p>
        <h2>Taking Back What’s Ours</h2>
        <p>I created this project because I want people to have the power to reclaim what’s theirs. I want privacy to stop being something that feels out of reach — something you need to be a hacker or a cybersecurity expert to achieve. I want privacy to be simple, practical, and available to everyone.</p>
        <p>Because the truth is, it doesn’t take advanced skills to protect yourself online. What it takes is knowledge — an understanding of how the digital world really works, how your information is collected, and how to take control of it again.</p>
        <p>That’s what this website is here to provide. Not lectures. Not jargon. Not fear. Just clear, actionable knowledge — because once you understand how privacy works, you can start taking it back piece by piece.</p>
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>My mission is simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To help people reclaim their privacy.</li>
          <li>To make privacy accessible to everyone, not just a select few.</li>
          <li>To show that protecting yourself online doesn’t require technical skills — only awareness and action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to live in a world where privacy is something people expect, not something they have to fight for. A world where individuals know how to guard their personal information, where they decide what to share and what to protect — and where that choice truly belongs to them.</p>
        <p>This project is a step toward that world. And if you’re here reading this, I hope it becomes a step for you too.</p>
