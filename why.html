      <h1>Why Privacy Matters</h1>
      <p class="lead">Privacy is a daily habit. It keeps you in charge of how your story appears to strangers, companies, and people who may not have your best interests at heart.</p>
      <section class="card">
        <p>Protecting your data makes it harder for scammers to target you with convincing lies. The less information they have, the fewer hooks they can use to trick you.</p>
        <p>Reducing your public footprint limits opportunities for stalking, impersonation, or identity theft. You decide what stays visible, and you can change it when life shifts.</p>
        <p>Privacy also shapes reputation. By curating what stays online, you make sure the highlights are yours to select—not snapshots taken out of context years ago.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, privacy is about choice. The steps in this guide help you take control over the data trails you leave behind so you can participate online on your terms.</p>
