# Manual Layering & Availability Audit â€” 2025-10-04

## Scope
- All public pages under `/PRIVACY` including home, ethics, why, platform hub, six platform playbooks, About, Contact, Disclaimer, Pledge, Access Denied, Offline, and 404.
- Shared layout assets in `assets/css/styles.css`, `assets/css/site.css`, `assets/js/main.js`, `assets/js/platform-guides.js`, and page-level templates.

## Steps
1. `python3 -m http.server 4173` to serve the static site locally.
2. `curl` each route covered by the Playwright suite to ensure files resolve with HTTP 200.
3. Read each template and shared stylesheet to inspect stacking contexts (`position`, `z-index`, sticky/fixed elements) and verify focusable overlays (skip links, menus, modals, back-to-top affordances).
4. Reviewed JavaScript controllers for navigation (`assets/js/main.js`), About TOC/back-to-top (`assets/js/about.js`), platform filtering (`assets/js/platform-guides.js`), pledge gate, and disclaimer modal to confirm they respect ARIA attributes and visibility toggles.

## Findings
- Skip link was rendered inside the sticky header without an explicit `z-index`, risking it being obscured by future positioned siblings. Added `z-index: 40` while focused.
- Global and About-specific back-to-top affordances relied on `position: fixed` without a stacking guarantee, which could place them beneath sticky headers or overlays on some browsers. Raised `z-index` to `60` in both `assets/css/styles.css` and `assets/css/site.css`.
- All audited routes returned 200 responses from the local HTTP server, confirming no missing files or mis-linked navigation targets.
- Ethics disclaimer modal already carries `z-index: 9999` and a focus trap; no changes required.

## Outstanding Risks
- Full visual regression via Playwright is still blocked because Chromium binaries cannot be downloaded inside this environment (`npx playwright install` fails with HTTP 403). Tests remain in place but require a network-enabled runner.
- Manual review could not simulate every responsive breakpoint; recommend rerunning Playwright once browsers are available to validate scroll locking, sticky sidebar behavior, and grid/list transitions.

## Next Actions
- Run `npx playwright install` in an environment with CDN access, then execute `npm test` to complete the automated audit suite.
- Capture responsive screenshots (mobile + desktop) of menu, disclaimer modal, and platform detail states once browser automation is restored.
