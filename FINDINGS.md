# Social Risk Audit – Post-remediation Notes

## Overview
- Replaced the previous single-page app with a minimal four-page static site.
- Simplified styling into one utility-first stylesheet and removed all unused scripts.
- Established a consistent navigation bar with system font stack and high-contrast palette.
- Centered content on practical Facebook steps, ethical guidance, and reasons to care about privacy.

## ✅ Working components
- **Navigation** – Skip link, sticky header, and active link highlighting on every page.
- **Facebook checklist** – Native `<details>` components provide collapsible steps without requiring JavaScript.
- **Accessibility hooks** – Focus outlines, semantic landmarks, and large touch targets meet WCAG guidance.
- **Offline fallback** – Lightweight offline page and optional service worker cache remain available for future activation.

## ⚠️ Follow-up ideas
- Add a visible reduced-motion toggle using the prepared dataset hook.
- Consider adding print-friendly PDFs or shareable summaries for each checklist.
- Expand platform coverage beyond Facebook based on user demand.
