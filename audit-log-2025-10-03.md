# Automated Audit Run â€” 2025-10-03

## Summary
- Installed project dependencies with `npm install`.
- Attempted to run the full Playwright regression suite via `npm test`.
- Test runner failed immediately because the Chromium browser binary was not present in the environment and Playwright could not download it.
- Additional attempts to install Chromium (via `npx playwright install chromium` and `apt-get install chromium-browser`) were blocked by upstream network restrictions on required binaries/snaps.

## Detailed Steps
1. `npm install`
   - Completed successfully and reported zero vulnerabilities.
2. `npm test`
   - Playwright attempted to launch Chromium for each project and failed with `Executable doesn't exist at /root/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1148/chrome-linux/headless_shell`.
   - Playwright reported that browsers need to be installed with `npx playwright install`.
3. `npx playwright install chromium`
   - Download attempts from the official Playwright CDN (`playwright.azureedge.net`) returned HTTP 403 `Domain forbidden` responses, preventing installation.
4. `apt-get install chromium-browser`
   - The Ubuntu transitional package installs a wrapper that relies on the Snap store.
   - Snap installation could not complete inside the container (`System doesn't have a working snapd, skipping`), leaving Chromium unavailable.

## Next Actions for a Successful Local Audit
- Re-run `npx playwright install chromium` from an environment with access to Playwright's CDN, or
- Provide a pre-installed Chromium binary and set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` or `executablePath` in `playwright.config.js` accordingly.

Once Chromium is available, rerun `npm test` to execute the complete audit suite.
